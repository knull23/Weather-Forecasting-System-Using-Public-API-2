# Weather Forecasting System

This repository contains a simple weather forecasting system implemented using Node.js, Express.js, EJS templates, and Axios for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Introduction

The project provides a web interface for users to check weather forecasts for different cities. Users can enter a city name, and the application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The fetched data includes information such as weather conditions, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature.

## Setup

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the code with your actual API key.
5. Start the server using `npm start`.
6. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `views/`: Contains EJS templates for rendering HTML content.
- `public/`: Static assets such as CSS files and images.
- `app.js`: Main application file containing the server logic.

## Dependencies

- Express.js: Web framework for Node.js.
- EJS: Embedded JavaScript templating engine.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests.
- Body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.

## Usage

- Navigate to the home page (`/`) to access the main interface.
- Enter a city name in the search box on the weather page (`/weather`) and click "Check Weather" to view weather forecasts for that city.
- The application will display weather conditions, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature for the specified city.

## SetUp Code
